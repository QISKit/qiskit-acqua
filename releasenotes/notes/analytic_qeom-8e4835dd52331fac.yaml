     The parent QEOM class (qiskit-aqua/qiskit/chemistry/algorithms/excited_states_solvers/qeom.py)
     has been updated with analytic_QEOM subclass so that calculations of excited states by the QEOM
     algorithm can now also be performed using analytical commutator evaluation and parallelized
     with MPI4PY. Analytical commutators are implemented in analytic_qeom_utils.py  and the mapping
     of n-body fermionic operators onto qubit operators is carried out in
     analytic_qeom_fermionic_operator.py.
