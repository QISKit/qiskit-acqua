features:
  - |
    Introduces ``transformations`` for the fermionic and bosonic transformation of a problem
    instance. Transforms the fermionic (or bosonic) operator to qubit operator
    Introduces ``ground_state_solvers`` for the calculation of ground state properties. The
    calculation can be done either using an ``MinimumEigensolver`` or using ``AdaptVQE``
deprecations:
  - |
    ``Core Hamiltonian`` class is deprecated in favor of the ``FermionicTransformation``
    ``Chemistry Operator`` class is deprecated in facor of the ``tranformations``
    ``minimum_eigen_solvers/vqe_adapt`` is also deprecate and moved as an implementation
    of the ground_state_solver interface
    ``applications/molecular_ground_state_energy`` is deprecated in favor of ``ground_state_solver``
