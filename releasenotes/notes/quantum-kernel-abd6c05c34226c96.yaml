features:
  - |
    Introduced new ``QuantumKernel`` class that computes a kernel matrix given
    datapoints x and y and feature map f, all of n dimension. This matrix
    can then be used in classical machine learning algorithms in ``sklearn``
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecate the ``QSVM`` algorithm, to be removed in a future release.
    Use ``QuantumKernel`` class to estimate quantum kernel and use
    `sklearn.svm.SVC` support vector machine implemetation for classification.
