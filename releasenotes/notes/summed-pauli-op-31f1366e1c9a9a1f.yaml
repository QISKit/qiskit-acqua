    Added :class:`~qiskit.aqua.operators.SummedPauliOp`, which is
    a new subclass of :class:`~qiskit.aqua.operators.PrimitiveOp`.
    ``SummedOp[PauliOp]`` is replaced with ``SummedPauliOp`` when
    it is not nested and coefficients are not ``ParameterExpression``.
    For example, ``X + Y`` becomes ``SummmedPauliOp``.
