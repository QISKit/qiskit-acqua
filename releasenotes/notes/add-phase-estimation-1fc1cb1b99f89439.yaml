    Adds new classes for phase estimation. PhaseEstimator performs phase estimation given
    a unitary and initial state. HamiltonianPE exponentiates a Hermitian operators using a
    subclass of EvolutionBase and performs phase estimation on the resulting unitary. These
    classes are supported by results classes PhaseEstimatorResult and HamiltonianPEResult.
