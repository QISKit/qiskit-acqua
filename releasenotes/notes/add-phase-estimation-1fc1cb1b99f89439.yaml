    Adds new classes for phase estimation. PhaseEstimator is an interface class
    for performing phase estimation given a unitary and initial
    state. PhaseEstimation is an implementation.  HamiltonianPhaseEstimation is
    a subclass of PhaseEstimation that exponentiates a Hermitian operators using
    a subclass of EvolutionBase and performs phase estimation on the resulting
    unitary. These classes are supported by results classes PhaseEstimatorResult
    and HamiltonianPhaseEstimationResult.
