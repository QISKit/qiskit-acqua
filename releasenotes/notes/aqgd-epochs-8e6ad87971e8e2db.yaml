upgrade:
  - Extension to the previous aqgd classical optimizer with the 
    Analytic Quantum Gradient Descent (AQGD) with Epochs optimizer.
    Performs gradient descent optimization with a momentum term, analytic gradients,
    and customized step length schedule for parametrized quantum gates, i.e.
    Pauli Rotations. Gradients are computed "analytically" using the quantum circuit when evaluating
    the objective function.
