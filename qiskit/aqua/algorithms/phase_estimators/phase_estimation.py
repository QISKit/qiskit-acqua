    """Run the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm.

    This runs a version of QPE with a multi-qubit register for reading the phase [1]. The main
    inputs are the number of qubits in the phase-reading register, a state preparation circuit to
    prepare an input state, and either
    1) A unitary that will act on the the input state, or
    2) A quantum-phase-estimation circuit in which the unitary is already embedded.
    In case 1), an instance of `qiskit.circuit.PhaseEstimation`, a QPE circuit, containing the input
    unitary will be constructed. After construction, the QPE circuit is run on a backend via the
    `run` method, and the frequencies or counts of the phases represented by bitstrings are
    recorded. The results are returned as an instance of
    :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.phase_estimator_result.PhaseEstimationResult`.

    If the input state is an eigenstate of the unitary, then in the ideal case, all probability is
    concentrated on the bitstring corresponding to the eigenvalue of the input state. If the input
    state is a superposition of eigenstates, then each bitstring is measured with a probability
    corresponding to its weight in the superposition. In addition, if the phase is not representable
    exactly by the phase-reading register, the probability will be spread across bitstrings, with an
    amplitude that decreases with distance from the bitstring most closely approximating the phase.

        How the frequencies are computed depends on whether the backend computes amplitude or

        1) If the backend is a statevector simulator, then the reduced density matrix of the
        phase-reading register is computed from the combined phase-reading- and input-state
        registers. The elements of the diagonal :math:`(i, i)` give the probability to measure the

        gives the state of the phase-reading register with the LSB leftmost when interpreted as a
        phase. In order to maintain the compact representation, the phases are maintained as decimal
        integers.  They may be converted to other forms via the results object,
        `PhaseEstimationResult` or `HamiltonianPEResult`.

         2) If the backend samples bitstrings, then the counts are first retrieved as a dict.  The
        binary strings (the keys) are then reversed so that the LSB is rightmost and the counts are
        converted to frequencies. Then the keys are sorted according to increasing phase, so that
