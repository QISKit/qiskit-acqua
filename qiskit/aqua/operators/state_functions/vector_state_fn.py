    """ A class for representing state functions and measurements.

    State functions are defined to be complex functions over a single binary string
    (as compared to an operator,
    which is defined as a function over two binary strings, or a function taking a
    binary function to another
    binary function). This function may be called by the eval() method.

    Measurements are defined to be functionals over StateFns, taking them to real values.
    Generally, this real value
    is interpreted to represent the probability of some classical state (binary string)
    being observed from a
    probabilistic or quantum system represented by a StateFn. This leads to the equivalent
    definition, which is that
    a measurement m is a function over binary strings producing StateFns, such that the
    probability of measuring
    a given binary string b from a system with StateFn f is equal to the inner product
    between f and m(b).

    NOTE: State functions here are not restricted to wave functions,
    as there is no requirement of normalization.
